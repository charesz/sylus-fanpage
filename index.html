         Sylus is a 28-year-old 6'2 ft / 190 cm tall muscular man. He has messy silver hair, bright red eyes, and sharp facial features. His right eye will sometimes glow red when he's using his Evol. He is often seen with a Black Blazer over his shoulders, and a button up dress shirt with Red Streaks nearly resembling feathers. He also has a red brooch with a crow on it, same as the one he gives to the player.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif;margin:0 0 8px">Personality</h2>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);margin-top:6px">
      Sylus is confident and direct. He rarely perceives anyone as a real threat because he is usually the most powerful person in the room. Even in dangerous situations, he remains calm and self-assured. Sylus hates being bored and appears to be a bit of a thrill seeker; preferring to use fast motorcycles, jump out of planes, and use explosives to deal with problems on multiple occasions. He is unforgiving to his enemies, but never uses undue force against the weak as his understanding of power dynamics is nuanced. Analytical and strategic, Sylus always plans several steps ahead, anticipating every possible outcome for any situation he faces. His intelligence also extends to mechanical engineering, having built and maintained his crow companion for surveillance.
        </p>
        
        <p style="color:var(--muted);margin-top:12px">
      Sylus' soft side appears with his habit of caring for wounded or helpless animals, and his tendency to take in "strays". His bonds with the twins (Luke and Kieran), Mephisto, and now the Player all show he is more vulnerable than he lets on.
        </p>

         <p style="color:var(--muted);margin-top:12px">
      Sylus is increasingly playful and affectionate toward the Player and enjoys fueling their ambition. He encourages the Player to boss him around and supports their efforts in developing and growing their own power, building their confidence. He sometimes teases the Player and speaks so smugly that it is hard to tell if he is being mocking or genuine, but the answer is usually both.

    <p style= color:var(--muted)>
      Similar in nature to a crow, Sylus loves shiny things. From gems to antiques, guns, and other weaponry, his collection is filled with glittering goods. It's a wonder Mephisto hasn't swooped in and stolen a piece or two!

         <li>He has 12+ armories around the world. What a sly crow!</li>
    <li>Despite his young age (28), Sylus has made a name for himself in the criminal underworld of the N109 Zone and abroad. Sylus began Onychinus by buying and selling illegal Evol weapons and Protocores.</li>
    <li>While the N109 Zone is a perpetually lawless place where even the Hunters Association hesitates to go, there is a ruling body... of sorts. Onychinus has stepped in as the most influential faction in the N109 Zone and whatever Sylus says, goes.</li>
    <li>There are other gangs in the N109 Zone that Onychinus has to deal with, but Onychinus always comes out on top, thanks to Sylus' deft leadership.</li>
    <li>Little else is known about the interior structure of Onychinus, but there are two more notable members underneath Sylus. Luke and Kieran are masked twins who function as Sylus' right (and left) hand men.</li>
    <li>The brothers are henchmen of a sort but seem to care deeply about Sylus. Outside of Mephisto, Luke and Kieran are also likely the only other individuals to know who Sylus really is. They even reveal to the MC that he does have a heart beneath his cold exterior.</li>
